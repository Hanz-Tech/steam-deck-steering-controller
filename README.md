# Steam Deck Steering Controller

I was watching F1 the other day and through the steering wheel looked like a steam deck. So I decided to turn the steam deck in to a steering wheel using off the shelf and 3d printed components.

# Features

* Auto return to center using rubber band
* Desk Mount
* Easy release mechanism for the steam deck
* Vents for steam deck

# How to assemble

Almost all of the parts were copied from Troglobit's [steam controller steering wheel](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2441049). The only part I designed was the steam deck holder.

You'll need to print all the parts under the stl folder. Additionally you'll need the following:


    1 x 150mm M8 bolt
    1 x 70mm M4 bolt
    2 x 50mm M4 bolt
    4 x 16mm M4 bolts
    1 x 10mm M4 bolt
    4 x M8 nuts
    3 x M5 nuts
    8 x M4 nuts
    1 x 55mm M5 wing bolt
    2 x 8mm pillow block ball bearings
    some rubber bands 

I recommend some thick and strong rubber bands as the steam deck is much heavier than the steam controller. It takes a lot more force for the return to center mechanism to work properly
